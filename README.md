``Hack4Fun's stealer (binded with GABB, but the stealer is still contained as it is a binded executable, couldn't find any other ones but still shouldn't affect the detection too much): ``https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/3ff369c72811b085d5fca439b77c3aac61a62be990b60e9cebe27d325aeddf48/detection

REMINDER: "ChattuyCS" is the client, and "Chattuy Server" the saveforwarder server. (initially used to be a chat server/client written by me)
